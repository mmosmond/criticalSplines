# criticalSplines
Predicting adaptation and persistence with cubic splines

This is a shiny app. It is currently hosted at http://shiney.zoology.ubc.ca/mmosmond/criticalSplines/. Alternatively, if you have R on your own computer, you can download the criticalSplines folder and run the shiny app on your own machine. Just set the working directory to be the location of the folder, using setwd(), and type runApp("criticalSplines"). This is my first shiny app, and I barely use R, so any comments are very welcome. Have fun!

I am working on a PDF with more about the purpose and method behind this. Stay tuned...
